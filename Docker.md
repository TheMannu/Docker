### **Scripting Approach to Download and Install Docker**

1. **Switch to root user**:
   ```bash
   sudo -i  # Change to root user for installation permissions
   ```

2. **Download Docker installation script**:
   ```bash
   curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com -o install-docker.sh  # Download the Docker installation script
   ```

3. **List files to verify the script is downloaded**:
   ```bash
   ls  # List files in the current directory to confirm the script's presence
   ```

4. **Run the installation script**:
   ```bash
   sudo sh install-docker.sh  # Execute the Docker installation script
   ```
